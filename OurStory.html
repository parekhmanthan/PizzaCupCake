      <h2>How It All Began: A Dream to Reinvent Pizza</h2>
      <p>The idea for The Pizza Cupcake was born in a small New York kitchen, where our founders, passionate food lovers, were experimenting with ways to make pizza more versatile and fun. They wanted to create something that captured the essence of a traditional pizza but could be enjoyed anywhere, anytime, without the hassle of slices or plates.</p>
      <p>After countless trials and taste tests, they struck gold with the perfect combination of soft, doughy crust, gooey cheese, and rich tomato sauce, all wrapped in a compact, cupcake-sized delight. The Pizza Cupcake was officially born, and it quickly became a hit among friends and family, who couldn’t get enough of this innovative treat.</p>

      <h2>What Makes The Pizza Cupcake Unique?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Our Signature Dough:</strong> Unlike traditional pizza dough, our dough is a hybrid between a soft brioche and a classic Neapolitan crust. It’s light, fluffy, and perfectly complements the savory fillings.</li>
        <li><strong>Premium Ingredients:</strong> We believe that great food starts with great ingredients. From vine-ripened tomatoes for our sauce to high-quality mozzarella cheese and fresh toppings, every component of The Pizza Cupcake is carefully selected to ensure maximum flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovative Design:</strong> The cupcake shape isn’t just for fun; it’s functional too. The compact size makes it easy to enjoy on the go, at parties, or as a quick snack without the mess of traditional pizza.</li>
      </ul>
